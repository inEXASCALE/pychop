Welcome to Pychop's documentation!
==================================

Using low precesion can gain extra speedup while resulting in less storage and energy cost. 
The intention of pychop, motivated by software ``chop`` in Matlab developed by Nick higham, 
is to simulate the low precision formats based on single and double precisions, 
which is pravalent on modern machine.  ``pychop`` is a Python package for simulaing low precision 
and quantization in modern machine, it supports NumPy, Torch,  or JAX backend. 


Installation guide
------------------------------
``pychop`` has the following dependencies for its functionality:

   * numpy>=1.21
   * pandas>=2.0
   * torch (only for Torch use)
   * jax (only for JAX use)
    
To install the current release via PIP use either of them according to one's need:

.. parsed-literal::
    
    pip install pychop



To check if the instalment is successful, one can load the package, simple use

.. code:: python

  import pychop


Floating point information
------------------------------
To give a shot, one may print information of various precision formats:

.. code:: python

  from pychop import float_params
  float_params()

.. admonition:: Note
   
   The documentation is still on going. We welcome the contributions in any forms.
