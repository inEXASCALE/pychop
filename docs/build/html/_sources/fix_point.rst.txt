Fixed point quantization
=====================================================

We start with a single or double precision (32 / 64 bit floating point) input X, 

The fixed point quantization demonstrates its superiority in U-Net image segmentation [1].
Following that, a basic bitwise shift quantization function is given by:

.. math::

    q(x) = \lfloor \texttt{clip}(x, 0, 2^b - 1) \ll b \rceil \gg b, 

where << and >> are left and right shift for bitwise operator, respectively. 

Then the given number $x$ to its fixed point value proceed by splitting its value into its fractional and integer parts:

.. math::

    x_f = \text{abs}(x) - \lfloor\text{abs}(x)\rfloor \quad \text{and} \quad x_i = \lfloor\text{abs}(x)\rfloor.


The fixed point representation for $x$ is given by 

.. math::

    Q_f{x} = \text{sign}(x) q(x_i) +  \text{sign}(x) q(x_f)
